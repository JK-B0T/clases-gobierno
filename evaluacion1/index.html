        <p>I'm a full stack web developer who can build apps from the ground up. I've worked mostly at startups so I am used to
            wearing many hats. I am a very product focused developer who prioritizes user feedback first and foremost. I'm
            generally very flexible when investigating new roles.</p>

                <p>Tokenized is a Bitcoin wallet for issuing, managing and trading digital tokens. I built out the front end which was
                    packaged as an electron app. It was a difficult frontend to build because we store the users keys locally and used them
                    to sign transactions and contracts.</p>

                <p>Blockbid is an Australian crypto currency exchange. I started off on the frontend but eventually became lead tech and
                    worked on every moving piece of the exchange. I really enjoyed working with liquidity providers and connecting their

                <p>“Thomas was hired as a lead developer and, upon the leaving of our co-founder took over as CTO of Earbits.
                    Thomas is, hands down, one of those A Players you hear of companies dying to hire. He is incredibly smart, not just
                    at code but about everything from classical music to Chinese language and culture. Thomas is great to work with
                    and, as a well established contributor to open source projects and several successful ventures, commands the
                    respect of engineers at all levels. I would suggest doing anything you can to have him on your team.”</p>
                    <strong>Joey Flores, Co-founder and CEO of Earbits, Inc</strong>

                <p>“I've had the great pleasure of working with Thomas for the past three years at Earbits, and on a few side projects.
                    Two years ago our CTO left on a moment's notice, Thomas saved our company by quickly stepping up to fill this role.
                    He has been with our company through thick and thin and made serious personal sacrifices in order to help the
                    company during tough times. He is a phenomenal hacker and a true team player. Highly recommended!”</p>
